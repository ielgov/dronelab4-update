                        <p class="UPDATE3">Throughout the lab, there will be several references to the <span class="tblue"><b>IBM Cloud SBaaS</b></span>. It is a Hybrid Multicloud <b>Sandbox as a Service (SBaaS)</b> platform which provides cloud services to enable our technical sellers to gain experience with IBM Cloud capabilities along with other industry Cloud platforms in a hands-on environment. Pre-packaged scenarios and technologies can be customized to build client specific PoCs/prototypes and show the value of IBM Cloud and Industry solutions to help clients with their cloud and digital transformation journeys.</p>

                     <p>The purpose of this lab is to consider how extending the capabilities of the Remote Drone Operations Console that you worked with in Lab 1 and Lab 2 can help deliver functionality within an industry context of Stormwater Operations. You may remember that the previous labs resulted in an application running in OpenShift within the IBM Cloud SBaaS that was connected to drones, sensors, and other cloud resources running in the <span class="UPDATE3">Global Industry Solutions</span> private cloud. The <b>purpose</b> of that application was to allow a user to see <span class="tblue">video output and telemetry data from a remote drone</span>, as well as to <span class="tblue">visualize and filter sensors and other resources</span> that were within the same geospatial area. In this lab, you will take that application a step <b>further</b> and bring <span class="tblue">additional insights</span> to a user who is concerned with public safety during situations where risks can occur during/after <b>heavy rainfall</b> accumulates in areas where pedestrian and vehicular traffic may become <b>dangerous</b>.</p>

                                    <p>Consider for a moment the challenges that cities today face to effectively mitigate and respond to excess stormwater on city roadways during and after heavy or prolonged rainfall. The stakes are high, as flooded roadways can impact traffic as well as citizen safety.</p>
                                    <p> Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for a city's command center operators to resort to making decisions without easy access to information and tools that can provide full situational awareness needed to assess, prioritize and respond to these stormwater flooding issues. In fact, many cities use manual processes to dispatch, track, and support their field responders who need to perform actions at the location of each given issue. Client-facing efforts around emergency management, public safety, traffic management, and stormwater operations management have clearly shown that operators need decision-support analytics and situational awareness that can simplify access to information and insights.</p>

                     <p>In the context of this Remote Drone application, you will learn how portfolio capabilities within the IBM Maximo Application Suite such as  Visual Inspection and Monitor provide analytic uplift on raw drone video footage and weather/stream sensor readings that can be leveraged to deliver insight directly to the fingertips of the Stormwater Operations Management command center operator. Specifically, you’ll get exposure to how visual analytic models can be trained and deployed within a Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI) environment based on a preliminary dataset of images or video and made available to external applications via an API endpoint. You'll even be able to test the deployed model via a custom user interface running in the IBM Cloud SBaaS.   Then, you will walk through how weather and water sensors can be managed and monitored via Maximo Monitor and the associated IoT Tool (Watson IoT Platform) to trigger alerts based on abnormal measurements. Finally, you’ll revisit the Remote Drone Console application to experience the new Stormwater Operations functionality where you’ll interact as a command center operator who is using the interface to remotely monitor the impacts of a severe thunderstorm in Coppell, TX. As a takeaway, you will be able to consider how visual and sensor analytics, when combined with insights from weather and other city data in a geospatial context, can help operators gain the kind of situational awareness that allows them to prioritize and coordinate their responsive actions.</p>

            <p>When you made a request to take this hands-on lab, there were some background tasks that were performed on your behalf in order to prepare the lab environment, which are described below. Don't worry if you have some questions about these concepts... you will get a lot more explanation and hands-on experience as you move through lab steps.</p>

            <p>
                <b>Created a Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI) environment within <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> Private Cloud</b><br/>

                Provisioned and installed Maximo Visual Inspection v 8.0 (as part of Maximo Application Suite 8.2) within an OpenShift Cloud Platform 4.6 environment with one worker node allocated on a bare metal machine containing a single Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU (graphical processing unit). We then created, trained, and deployed a custom object detection model that would be relevant for stormwater management operations.  To do this, we also took drone footage near the <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> location in Coppell, TX to be used throughout the lab. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Created a Maximo Monitor within <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> Private Cloud</b><br/>

                Provisioned and installed Maximo Monitor version 8.0  and IoT Tool (Watson IoT Platform) as part of Maximo Application Suite 8.0, within an OpenShift Cloud Platform 4.4 environment. We then created a series of sample sensors based on project experience with actual weather and river/stream sensors from the DFW area and configured to support a stormwater use case.

                Created a demo account on Watson Media and created MVI and Maximo Monitor training material that will be embedded in this lab via the Watson Media <i>Video Streaming</i> service.
            </p>-->

            <p>
                <b>Created a custom MVI test application <span class="UPDATE3">in</span> the IBM Cloud SBaaS</b><br/>

               Created a small application to allow the user to interact with the <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> Private Cloud instance of the MVI Stormwater model API from IBM Cloud SBaaS over a secure tunnel enabled via Cloud Satellite Link.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Established <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> infrastructure as IBM Cloud Satellite Location</b><br/>

                IBM Cloud Satellite enables local <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> resources to be utilized as a Satellite location by using the infrastructure already present in that location. To achieve the necessary GIS Satellite location configuration, a set of hosts machines were dedicated in order to deploy Satellite control planes that could the manage GIS cluster. This established a secure Satellite link between IBM Cloud and the GIS location. Satellite Link uses Link Endpoints configured on this private GIS environment to enable the IBM Cloud SBaaS Remote Drone Console application functionality that will be leveraged as part of the lab's Visual Inspection test page and Remote Drone Console Application functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Deployed a project and artifacts for each lab user in the IBM Cloud SBaaS</b><br/>

               A project with an updated Remote Drone Console Application with custom Stormwater Operations functionality was created and deployed for each lab user in a IBM Cloud SBaaS OpenShift Cloud Platform 4.5 cluster. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Adding each user to the IBM Cloud SBaaS environment</b><br/>

                The new user was first given user permissions to an existing IBM Cloud organization for the SBaaS environment that was provisioned for the lab. A new project was then created specifically for that user in the OpenShift Cloud Platform 4.5 cluster within that organization, and user policies were applied to enable the permissions necessary for completion of the lab steps.

                                Our Remote Drone Console Operators can further gain insights from drone imagery using <b>IBM Maximo Visual Inspection</b> to analyze the drone images using classification or object detection. Based on trained models, multitudes of images sent by many camera/drone sources can have analytics applied in order to quickly and effectively identify patterns or problems. This allows operators to focus on the insights across sources rather than trying to try to monitor raw imagery. </p> 
                                
                                <p>In our stormwater management use case, you can imagine how critical it is for operators to maintain some level of situational awareness. They must be able to assess risks during disruptive weather events when dangerous conditions can impact traffic and directly threaten the safety of citizens and first responders. In this step, you will explore IBM Maximo Visual Inspection, and ultimately consider how its powerful analytics can be leveraged to raise insights about stormwater in close proximity to  vehicular and pedestrian traffic that can help assess and prioritize the public safety response.</p>

MVI is intelligence that drives automation of existing manual processes in addition to enabling subject matter experts to easily and quickly use AI computer vision, in order to build highly accurate customized AI models. It also is compatible with Edge and mobile.</p>

Often, challenging operating environments in the field exist as well. As a result, adding a level of <b>intelligent oversight</b> that can look for errors 24/7 in the operations or output of an asset can be very beneficial. MVI uses the power of AI to detect errors and defects, with alerts to operators to take action, avoiding disruptions that could take down operations. </p>

                                The OpenShift® cluster where Maximo Visual Inspection is deployed must have 1 or more worker nodes with 1 or more Nvidia GPUs available for training models. For more information about hardware requirements, see "Application-specific requirements" in Maximo Application Suite system requirements.  For this lab, there is an MVI instance with a GPU-enabled worker node running in the Dallas <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> Private Cloud. </p>

                    <div class="sectionTitle">1.2.1</div>

                    <p>Once the user has captured frames (either manually or using MVI’s auto-capture capability) in the new data set based on the imported images or video, the user can now start to <b>annotate</b> those frames by labeling the objects that should be detected in future images. An object is used to identify specific items in an image or specific frames in a video. You can label multiple objects in an image or a frame in a video. An example of objects in an image of cars might be a wheel, headlights, and windshield. In our stormwater use case, we will be labeling vehicles, water, flooding, people, buildings, etc. </p>

                    <div class="UPDATE3 grayBox">

                    <p>Image Classification can be used to build a solution that can examine an image and properly classify it according to your model. For example, the model can examine images of a flooding situation and can classify if the flooding is happening on a road or low-level water crossing bridge and thus helps to determine the flooding severity. In the above use case, you train a model to recognize flooding happening on a road versus low-level water crossing bridge categories.</p>
                    
                    <p>In this lab, we use Object Detection model rather than Image Classification model to determine if a vehicle is passing through a flooded region by examining the image for a vehicle object, water, and splashes around the wheels of the car. If all of the above objects are detected in an image,  the system can determine that a vehicle is passing through a flooded region which is one of the main public safety issues during stormwater monitoring.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the video below, you will learn how to create an object detection model by labeling objects. The video initially shows how to label a vehicle and flooding object and later uses a trained deployed model to auto-label the entire data set. This is a <span class="tblue"><b>unique feature</b></span> of MVI. In the real world, based on your scenario, you will train the model with objects that you think are appropriate for detection and this might result in some false positives (a false positive result is when IBM Maximo Visual Inspection labels an image when it should not have -  for example, detecting an A/C unit on top of a building as 'vehicle' in the drone video). The users have to create new labels (e.g 'A/C unit') to re-train the model to avoid false positives. Determining what objects to label can be an iterative effort, and is often based on an understanding of what type of object is present in the images that you are using in order to train the model.</p>

                    <p>Once the user has annotated the desired objects via labels within the frames in the data set, the user is now ready to use those labeled frames to train the MVI model. A model is simply a set of tuned algorithms and that produces a predicted output. Models are trained based on the input that is provided by a data set to classify images or video frames or find objects in images or video frames. There are additional training concepts and terminology involved (iteration, batch, batch size, epoch, etc.), but it is not necessary for a user to become an expert in these concepts within MVI to produce a model. </p>

                    <p>Below is a video walkthrough of the Train Model process that explains step-by-step how the user can navigate through the MVI interface, starting immediately after the Prepare Data has been performed to define the objects to be detected.

                                <p>As you saw in previous walkthroughs, IBM Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI) is a powerful tool that enables even non-technical users to create  and deploy custom AI models that can then be used to perform visual analytics on images or video.   After deploying the model, you saw that it can be tested within the MVI interface, but it is important to consider how that model can be leveraged by external applications. For example, our  Remote Drone Console Application will use the MVI API to detect objects from the drone images during a weather incident and then use those insights to facilitate situational awareness and raise alerts about potential threats from a public safety context. </p>

The test page will contain various activities that will demonstrate IBM MVI capabilities, in addition to further information on the service and how the test page was created.</p>

                        Before we move on, let’s spend a moment to recap what has been covered:<br/><br/>
                        ✅ Consideration of how video analytics can help Stormwater Operations users to derive insights from drone images and other sources<br/>
                        ✅ Introduction to Maximo Visual Inspection, its architecture, and its alignment within the Maximo Application Suite.<br/>
                        ✅ Capabilities of MVI, and overall steps required to create a data set, prepare/label the data, train the model and deploy <br/>
                        ✅ Example hybrid cloud flow between a simple test application hosted in an OpenShift cluster within IBM Cloud SBaaS and the Maximo Visual Inspection instance hosted in an OpenShift cluster in the IBM <span class="UPDATE3">GIS</span> Private Cloud.<br/>
                        ✅ Some exposure to how a program can send images to the MVI API, and parse the results to overlay on the image (and/or to be used to trigger alerts). <br/>

                                            In our stormwater management use case, you can imagine how critical it is for operators to be able to maintain some level of situational awareness. They must be able to assess risks during disruptive weather events when dangerous conditions can impact traffic and directly threaten the safety of citizens and first responders. In this step, you will explore IBM Maximo Monitor and its IoT Tool (Watson IoT Platform) in the context of weather and water/stream sensors  and ultimately consider how its powerful analytics can be leveraged to raise insights about changing conditions (raising water, increasing wind speed, etc.) to help assess and prioritize the public safety response.

                                Flow volume sensors help to monitor the behavior of water in streams/rivers by measuring the volume of liquid moving through an area. This measurement is reported in the U.S as cubic feet per second (cfs).  One cubic foot of water is 7.48 gallons of water. A gallon of water weighs 8.35 pounds. So, one cubic foot of water weighs over 62 pounds. From the above example, a flow of 1,000 cfs means <b>over 62,000 pounds of water is flowing downstream every second</b>! Information on flows in cubic feet per second can be found online at the <a href="https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/?id=ww_current" target="_blank">U.S Geological Survey</a>.</p>

In fact, this flow volume sensor's attributes and example sensor readings are actually leveraged in the sections that follow during the setup of the device connections and monitoring within Maximo Monitor and its IoT Tool.

                    <p>Given the frequency and volume of sensor data that is available, it is crucial to manage and monitor the sensors and their associated measurements. IBM Maximo Monitor and its IoT Tool, with its proven approach and  maturity, were designed to help operators maintain a healthy ecosystem of sensors and evaluate the resulting measurement data in a format that is intuitive for their needs. In the Stormwater Operations context, we will start by looking at a flow volume sensor that would be common to monitor the behavior of water in streams/rivers. For example, flow volume sensors can help measure when the volume of water <span class="UPDATE3">is</span> moving through an area at an increased rate, thus making a river unsafe to travel on/across. </p>

                    <p>Below is a video walkthrough of the Device Creation process that explains step-by-step how the user can navigate through the Maximo Monitor’s IoT Tool  interface, starting immediately after logging in.

                     <p>Now that we have data flowing into our Maximo Monitor environment via the IoT Tool for a given sensor on a defined interface,  we want to be able to do something useful with the data.  Maximo Monitor makes it very easy to create alerts based on the data values, as well as to customize visualizations via dashboards.  In our stormwater use case, imagine being able to use a dashboard to monitor all relevant sensors from a common interface, showing trends and anomalies that quickly get the attention of the operator when needed.  Furthermore, imagine this same platform to trigger alerts and send to external systems (like the Remote Drone Console application’s Stormwater Management function) so that these sensor alerts can be seen alongside other insights to facilitate a more complete sense of situational awareness for the operator.</p>

                            In the previous <b>Drone Labs</b>, you worked extensively with the containerized Remote Drone Console Application in the IBM Cloud SBaaS environment, and along the way learned about <b>Red Hat OpenShift</b> and <b>Cloud Integration</b> in a <b>Hybrid Multicloud context</b>.</p>  
                        
                        <p>
                            In Drone Lab 1, the goal was to make you more comfortable with the relationship between <b>GitHub</b> and <b>RedHat OpenShift</b> on <b>IBM Cloud</b> (and optionally on <b>AWS Cloud</b>) and provide a better understanding of the overall process to take an application from code/configuration all the way through to its containerized cloud deployment. Along the way, hopefully you were able to get a preliminary hands-on experience with the concept of a cloud “operator” that can gain some benefit via the Remote Drone Console Application (in the IBM Cloud) to visualize and interact with drones in a remote setting.</p>
                            
                            <p>In Drone Lab 2, you focused on learning how the various IBM Cloud Integration services (<b>Secure Gateway, Cloud Satellite,  API Connect, and App Connect</b>) can be leveraged to enable an application in a hybrid cloud context, and thus augment its security, functionality, and connectivity. You also explored how these services could be put to use within the Remote Drone Console Application to “connect” to remote resources through the use of the above services.  After connection to a remote drone environment, you were able to view the images, telemetry, measurements, and even GPS from a drone, and then view readings from sensors that were located within a drone’s geospatial proximity. With the Remote Drone Console Application, you interacted as an operator to see how they could benefit from having access to the (raw) information collected via the drone to help them monitor a situation.</p>

                        <p>
                            As you prepare to revisit the Remote Drone Application again in this lab, you now know that IBM’s capabilities can further benefit the “operator” of this cloud application by infusing AI and analytics into the application and thus bringing forth insights from the raw drone and sensor data that can be applied within a government industry context around managing stormwater during a weather event. Using the technologies and approaches within Maximo Application Suite’s <b>Visual Inspection</b> and <b>Monitor</b> that you learned in this lab’s previous steps, you will now get hands-on experience as an operator that can leverage the new <span class="tblue"><b>Stormwater Operations Monitor</b></span> interface to gain situational awareness, assess risk, and coordinate mitigation response to dangerous flooding conditions. By tailoring the interface with industry context, you will see the concept of the Remote Drone Console Application become a persona-based solution for the operator, with access to video and analytics that can be compared with alerts from sensors and other sources, and then assessed within a geospatial context. From there, the operator has the tools and insights necessary to devise a mitigation/response plan using additional support from guided workflows, predictive models, and virtual support.</p>
                        <p>
                            As you progress through this step of the lab, you will empathize with the operator persona during a weather event, and <b>experience</b> how the Remote Drone Console Application’s new Stormwater Operations Monitor capabilities can help to make use of the insights that surfaced from the analysis and processing of the drone and sensor data.  Within the solution interface, you will see how an operator can leverage those insights to understand the risks that emerge during the unfolding situation and utilize AI-driven guidance to help plan and coordinate the response.</p></div>

                <p><b>Let’s review what we accomplished in this lab overall:</b> </p>

                <p>
                    First, we learned about the challenges city command center operators face as they  manage weather situations that endanger the public and put first responders at risk and considered how drone imagery and sensor measurements could be helpful inputs to help them gain situational awareness and assess risks during a storm event. </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        Next, we got some exposure the Maximo Application Suite, and specifically Visual Inspection (MVI) and Monitor capabilities.</p> 

                    <p>
                        In Step 1, we walked through how to create, train, and deploy a Maximo Visual Inspection object detection model, and then tested that model from a custom interface running in a hybrid cloud context. Throughout, we considered how operators could leverage insights from drone images that were processed via MVI in a stormwater scenario.</p> 

                    <p>
                        In Step 2, we experienced Maximo Monitor and its IoT Tool (Watson IoT Platform), and walked though how to setup a flow volume sensor (create new sensor type, define interfaces, connect/simulate device) and then configure alert thresholds, summary reports, and dashboards. Again, we considered how operators could monitor alerts or see trends from these sensors during stormwater scenario.</p> 

                    <p>
                        Finally, we got some hands-on interaction with the extended Stormwater Management functionality of our previous Remote Drone Console application.  There, we considered how MVI and Maximo Monitor can bring important insights into the operator’s the overall situational awareness during weather events by raising alerts based on detected objects in the drone video and from anomalies in the relevant sensor measurements.</p>   

                    <p>
                        The takeaway of this lab is to have an understanding the very common Government industry scenario of managing a public safety during a localized weather event that can potentially endanger citizens, property, and responders.  With the help of Maximo Application Suite’s Visual Inspection and Monitor capabilities, IBM can turn raw data into insights that can help stormwater management or command center operators to assess risk and then prioritize and coordinate response.  Hopefully, you also got more comfortable with MVI, Maximo Monitor, and the associated IoT tool, and learned that they have a very user-friendly approach with intuitive interface, and thorough documentation.</p>
